## 💻 How I got into computer science:

 I attend college at University of California Santa Cruz where I got a B.A. in Psychology. After working in the field of mental health for several years I became fustrated with the electronic records system and other administrative systems used by the company and started comming up with solutions. I created better versions of forms used by staff for documentation, added automation to excell spredsheets, and other simple changes. This is where I discovered databases.

 Having some light expeirance making websights and coding in python, databases and the clean and efficent way the organized and haldeled data was beautiful to me. I took night classes at the [Universtity of California Los Angeles Exenshion](https://www.uclaextension.edu/digital-technology/data-analytics-management/certificate/database-management) where I recieved a Certificate in Database management and then studdied on my own to pass the Microsoft Certification test for [MTA: Database Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/mta-database-fundamentals/). 

 I decided I wished to change career paths and after talking to several people working as database administrators I realized I needed a more solid foundtaion in programing as a whole. I found the Holberton School and after a few delays in enrolment due to Covid-19, began the full-time project baised 18 month program in Tulsa, OK. I have currently completed the Foundations half of the program and chose Machiene Learning for the Specialization portion of my program.

After participateing in the People to People program where I discovered that indepth knowlage of medical procedures elicits a physically mirrored pain response when I see them. I decided not to got to medical school. (Not on the level mirror synesthesia, but it is deeply unplesent.)
